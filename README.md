# Fargo 

Fargo is a JSON parsing library heavily inspired by a functional JSON parsing library [Argo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/Argo). Started out as a fork but changed many concepts, mainly, in order to support iOS 7.0, Fargo is not a framework (although can be used as such). Also, all custom operators are replaced with functions and most dependencies are removed.


## Installation

### Git Submodules

Until we can ditch iOS 7.0 support, this is the preferred installation method.

Add this repo as a submodule, and add all the files from `Fargo` subfolder to your workspace.

You'll also need to add [Box] to your project the same way.

## Usage tl;dr:

For more examples on how to use Fargo, please check out the tests.
